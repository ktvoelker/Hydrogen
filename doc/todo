====

Change the top-level runner code

  If the user code doesn't use IO, that shouldn't be a problem

  If the user code doesn't return (), that shouldn't be a problem

Finish porting FLang over to Hydrogen

Switch to strict IO, somehow (perhaps conduit?)

Switch from String to Text (and system-filepath)
