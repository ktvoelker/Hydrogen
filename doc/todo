====

Use regular expressions instead of recursive parser for the lexer

  This would allow better tokenization without the risk of backtracking

  Also, we could clean up the production of tokens by using a conduit

Get rid of all uses of Monad in Lexer and Parser

Convert to AParsec

Think about single-token interpolation more deeply

Eliminate String more completely

  Hide Prelude and Data.List functions dealing only with String

    Provide replacements as needed

  Hide the old Show and Read classes in place of Text-based ones

    Use Builder in Show

    Provide a less crazy type in Read

Allow nested block comments, optionally
