Bring back InputFile in some form

  It's annoying to have the first phase force IO on the whole pipeline
  when the output is IO-free

Eliminate String more completely

  Hide Prelude and Data.List functions dealing only with String

    Provide replacements as needed

  Hide the old Show and Read classes in place of Text-based ones

    Use Builder in Show

    Provide a less crazy type in Read
